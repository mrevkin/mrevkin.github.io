I am a political scientist and legal scholar conducting empirical research on legal systems during and after conflict with a regional focus on the Middle East. My research and teaching interests are in the areas of criminal law and procedure, international law, and transitional justice. Currently, I am the National Security Law Fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center.

I hold a J.D. from Yale Law School and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, where my dissertation on the Islamic State (IS)’s system of governance in Iraq and Syria and its post-conflict consequences included articles on (1) IS’s system of taxation, (2) civilian experiences with and perceptions of IS rule, and (3) Iraqi public opinion concerning punishment, forgiveness, and reintegration of individuals who have been detained by Iraqi authorities on charges of collaborating with IS. This dissertation was based on an original dataset documenting IS’s governance activities across time and space, a door-to-door survey of 1,458 residents of the Iraqi city of Mosul, and in-depth interviews with more than 300 Syrians and Iraqis who lived in IS-controlled areas conducted during 18 months of fieldwork in Turkey and Iraq. During my dissertation research, I served as the lead researcher on Iraq and Syria for United Nations University, the research wing of the UN system, for two projects on child recruitment by armed groups and post-IS transitional justice. 

My current research aims to contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for strengthening rule of law and state legitimacy after war. In partnership with the International Organization for Migration, I am conducting a study on civilian-police relations in Iraq. I am also working with the United Nations Development Programme’s Iraq mission to study the prospects for peaceful return and reintegration of families with perceived affiliation to IS.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in The Journal of Politics, The Journal of Conflict Resolution, World Development, The Harvard National Security Journal, The Annual Review of Law and Social Science, Foreign Affairs, and The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Law, among others. Before entering academia, I was a Junior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Middle East Program), a Critical Language Scholar in Jordan, and a Fulbright Fellow in Oman. I hold a B.A. in Political Science and Arabic from Swarthmore College.
